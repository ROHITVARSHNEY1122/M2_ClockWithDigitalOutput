# Requirements
## Introduction 
- Clock with digital output is the project application that allows user to see time in digital format so user will understand the present time with this application .
## Research
- This application is researched from various sources (like you tube , google and research papers ) and  then I have  modified into successful working model application with multiple header files and multiple c files  but simulation part is still under process till yet now .
### Features
- It is a clock with digital output hence shows discrete values of time .
- When get rebooted , output will not change .
### Who
- Everyone who wants to have a eye track on time .
### What
- Time with digital output showing system.
### Why
-  curious about carrier in embedded system . 
### When 
-  When you understand the importance of time management and start to be accountable for your time.
### Where
-  This can be  used by the user in day to day life where they can track their time and  generate better results in life .
### How
-  By using Atmega328p microcontroller for controlling and we program it and then we have to load firmware in elf or hex format in simulation software called  SimulIDE .
